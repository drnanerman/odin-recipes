    <h1>Dad's Hamburger Recipe</h1>
        <img src="../images/hamburger.jpeg" alt="my father's very delicious hamburger recipe">

    <h3>Description</h3>
        This is my fathers personal recipe for his homemade burgers. They might not be the best but they remind me of better times, of when I was younger, when he would talk about life and I wouldn't understand anything he was saying.
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bag of disposable styrofoam plate</li>
                <li>Any cheap hamburger buns with sesame seeds</li>
                <li>A 10 pack of the generic brand of hamburger patties</li>
                <li>A pack of kraft american cheese</li>
                <li>A can of diced pineapples</li>
                <li>A pack of sliced smoked ham</li>
                <li>Sour Cream</li>
                <li>Letuce</li>
                <li>A bag of charcoal</li>
            </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps to create the burger</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the charcoal in the grill and light it with paper towels.</li>
            <li>After around 5 minutes of the charcoal being lit, season the burger with steak seasoning and place the burger patties on the grill.</li>
            <li>Flip pattie every 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the patties are around 70% done cooking, place the cheese onto the pattie.</li>
            <li>Once the patties are around 75% done cooking, grab a set of burger buns and put sour cream on them and place on grill.</li>
            <li>If anyone would like ham on their burger, place one slice of smoked ham onto the burger pattie.</li>
            <li>After around 2 minutes of the burger buns being on the grill, they should be removed as to not burn them.</li>
            <li>Grab a styrofoam plate and assemble your burger. Grab your buns, your burger, and put letuce and or diced pineapple on your burger if you'd like.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your burger!</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Enjoy your homemade burger made by your own father!</h3>
