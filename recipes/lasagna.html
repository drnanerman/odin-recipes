    <h3>Steps to Assemble the Lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet or pot, cook the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Break them apart into crumbles as they cook.
            Add the chopped onion and minced garlic. Sauté until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant.
            Stir in the crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper.
            Simmer the sauce for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust seasonings to taste</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, chopped parsley, egg, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
            In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom.
            Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce.
            Spread half of the ricotta mixture evenly over the noodles.
            Sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta mixture.
            Add another layer of noodles, followed by a layer of meat sauce.
            Repeat the layering with the remaining ricotta mixture, mozzarella cheese, noodles, and meat sauce.
            Finish with a generous layer of shredded mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes.
            Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Allow the lasagna to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
            Garnish with additional chopped parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>This recipe balances classic lasagna flavors with some extra depth from the Italian sausage and a touch of heat from the red pepper flakes. The ricotta mixture adds creaminess, while the layers of cheese create a satisfying melt-in-your-mouth experience. Enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna that would make even Garfield the Cat proud!</h3>
