            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce (homemade or store-bought)</li>
                <li>8 oz (225g) fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
                <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
                <li>2-3 ripe tomatoes, sliced</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>Olive oil for drizzling</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps to Assemble the Pizza</h3>
        <h3>1. Prepare the dough</h3>    
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until the mixture becomes frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
                <li>Mix the ingredients until a dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise for about 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>2. Preheat the oven</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go (usually around 500째F/260째C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>3. Roll out the dough</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Punch down the risen dough and turn it out onto a floured surface. Roll it out into your desired pizza shape and thickness.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>4. Assemble the Pizza</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough onto a parchment paper-lined pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
                <li>Place the sliced mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce.</li>
                <li>Arrange the tomato slices on the cheese. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>5. Bake the pizza</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If using a pizza stone, slide the parchment paper with the assembled pizza onto the preheated stone in the oven. If not using a stone, simply place the baking sheet with the pizza in the oven.</li>
                <li>Bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>6. Finish the pizza</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Wear oven mitts or any other sufficiant gloves to take your pizza out the oven</li>
                <li>Once the pizza is out of the oven, sprinkle fresh basil leaves over the top.</li>
                <li>Drizzle a bit of olive oil over the pizza for extra flavor.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>7. Profit</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Let the pizza cool slightly before slicing into wedges. Serve and enjoy your homemade Margherita pizza!</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Feel free to customize the toppings according to your preferences. Enjoy your delicious homemade pizza straight from the oven!</h3>
